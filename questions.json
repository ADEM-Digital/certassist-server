The symptoms of clubbing of the fingers and cyanosis are indicative of chronic hypoxemia, which is common in advanced stages of COPD. A low level of serum AAT is characteristic of the disorder, and genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific pathogenic variant in the SERPINA1 gene. Cystic fibrosis is another inherited disorder that can cause respiratory and digestive problems, but it is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a chloride channel. Bronchiectasis and primary ciliary dyskinesia are both conditions that can cause chronic respiratory symptoms, but they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria.
